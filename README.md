# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to use GeoJSON data to map earthquake data. We created a streets layer group, a satellit layer group, and a dark layer group that the user is able to select. We also included a toggle for all earthquakes, the tectonic plates, and major earthquakes. The circles that indicate earthquakes have a pop-up feature that displays the magnitude of the earthquake as well as its location.
